## Description

Even after you leave a zoom meeting, zoom remains open in the background. This is probably so zoom can send you notifications, but it is probably unnecessary for most people. Plus their are privacy concerns. I couldn't find any settings that would prevent it from running in the background, so I wrote this script. It detects if zoom is running in the background without a zoom window open, then shuts it down.

**Note:** When zoom is shut down by the script, the zoom icon will still show in the taskbar. This is just a visual glitch.
