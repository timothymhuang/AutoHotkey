# Timothy's AutoHotkey Scripts

This is a collection of all of Timothy's AutoHotkey scripts that he wants to share. A lot of the scripts I make are just for fun (like pressing Alt + F4 increasing your internet speed), but some of my scripts are useful (like prevent zoom from running in the background).

## License

Unless otherwise noted, all scrips are released to the public under the [GNU General Public License](https://github.com/timothymhuang/AutoHotkey/blob/main/LICENSE). Most of my scripts are designed to run by themselves. However some scripts are designed to be used inside of other scripts and will include an MIT license instead.

## List of Scripts

Here is a list of all the scripts that you can find here

- Alt F4 = Faster Internet
  - Just for fun, whenever you press Alt + F4, a loading bar displays that claims to increase your internet speed.
- Mouse Button Keyboard
  - Just for fun, use your mouse forward and backward buttons to cycle through letters and type words.
