# Timothy's AutoHotkey Scripts

This is a collection of all of Timothy's AutoHotkey scripts that he wants to share. A lot of the scripts I make are just for fun (like pressing Alt + F4 increasing your internet speed), but some of my scripts are useful (like prevent zoom from running in the background).
